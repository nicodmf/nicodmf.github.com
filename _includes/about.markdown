ifup.org is the weblog of Brandon Philips and contains excerpts from my
[code](/git), [work](/portfolio) and [play](/violin).

I write Linux software and work on the systems layer of Linux. In the
last two years I have helped to organize [Linux Plumbers
Conf](http://linuxplumbersconf.org) and [Freedom HEC
Taipei](http://freedomhectaipei.pbwiki.com). It has been rewarding to
bring together these communities to discuss current Linux issues.

Robotics is another passion and I had the opportunity to [mentor a FIRST
Robotics team](/2008/02/09/six-weeks-to-robot-at-ignite-portland/) in
Portland recently too. I also continue to work with my friend [Ron
Jackson](http://www.fascinatingelectronics.com) to build some neat USB
devices for robotics.
